Predictive analytics model for workplace accidents using Python
# Workplace Accident Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts workplace accidents using historical OHS data.

## Project Overview

This project builds a predictive model to identify high-risk scenarios for workplace accidents. Using OSHA injury data, the model analyzes factors like job types, project details, and environmental conditions to predict severe injuries.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis of workplace accident data
- Feature engineering from text descriptions and categorical variables
- Random Forest classification model with hyperparameter tuning
- Risk zone heatmap visualization to identify high-risk combinations
- Prediction function for assessing risk in new scenarios

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
